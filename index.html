	<h2>My hobbies</h2>

		<p>
			I appreciate doing a lot of things. I consider myself quite open to <strong>experiencing new stuff</strong>. I can enjoy both really calm actvities (watching animes at home with  <strong>a cup of popcorn 🍿</strong> or <strong>reading books 📗</strong>) or  <strong>extreme ones</strong> (go canyoning in a new country 🌊, organize a road trip with friends 🚗). 
			Over the years, I have developed a special interest for <strong>Asia 💮</strong>, which is why I chose to put some extra effort into learning more about those 3 specific cultures:
			
		</p>

		<h3>🇯🇵 Japanese 🇯🇵</h3>
		<p>
			I have been in contact with the Japanese culture since I was young. I also hurried home to watch my favorite <strong>animes</strong> and hoped that my mother got me some <strong>mangas </strong> to read. I soon wanted to learn more about Japan and started <strong>learning Japanese</strong>, but the only things I have left from this are a few notions of broken Japanese... 
			<p id="op-small">
				
				For your information, the music linked and the background of the website are both from the anime One Piece, which I keep close to my heart. The song is the French version of Binks no sake, a song pirates used to sing while sailing. Overall, those two things are deep symbols of childhood, friendship, loyalty, commitment and freedom to me, hence why I chose to include them in my website. 

			</p id="op-small">
		</p>

		<h3>🇨🇳 Chinese 🇨🇳</h3>
		<p>
		As a sophomore, I chose to take <strong>Chinese class</strong> in order to know more about the culture. I did not know a lot about China, and given the place the country has in the world, being offered Chinese classes was <strong>an amazing oppurtunity.</strong> I chose to keep taking this class at ESSEC and <strong>I do not regret it one bit!</strong> Chinese truly is an amazing language and <strong>a bridge</strong> to other Asian languages. 
		</p>


		<h3>🇰🇷 Korean 🇰🇷</h3>
		<p>
			From Japanese I turned to <strong>Korean culture.</strong> Music, dramas, traditions, monuments, history... I started wanting to learn <strong>everything</strong> about this country. Which is what I did. I learnt how to <strong>read and speak Korean</strong> (only enough to hold a conversation and understand most of the basic things said). My friends and I chose to take over the <strong>Korean association of ESSEC</strong> which had been forgotten for a few years.

	<h2>My trips</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, I will talk about the trips I took during my years at ESSEC, since they also contributed to the person I am today.
		</p>

		<h3>Canada</h3>

			<p>
				I had the opportunity to go on an exchange in <strong>Canada</strong>  It was awesome and I made a lot of friends :)

			</p>

			<h3>Mexico</h3>
			<section><img id="ek" src="images/Singe.jpg" alt="Singe" style="width:35%;">
				<img id="ek" src="images/CI.jpg" alt="Chichen Itza" style="width:35%;"></section>
			<p>
				During my exchange and while we were taking online classes, we took the opportunity to go to <strong>Mexico</strong>! It was a healing for all of us, especially in the midst of COVID.  
			</p>

		<h3>South Korea</h3>

			<p>
				Lastly, I finally had the chance to go to <strong>South Korea</strong>. It was a dream come true, and I learned a lot about myself over there.

	<h2>About music</h2>
		<p>
			As we could expect from someone my age, I really enjoy listening to music. I can listen to each and every type of music, whether it is rap, electro, foreign, 70's, rock... I am always open to suggestions! Here are some of my playlists:
